## About The Project
Genova is a web-based genomic analysis platform built with the Streamlit framework in Python.It asks for information like family history, substance use, and stress exposure (the phenotype) and then interprets this information in the context of underlying genetic risk factors (the genotype).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of Genova up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/soumyami24/Genova.git](https://github.com/soumyami24/Genova.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Genova
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project folder and add the following lines to it.)*
    ```
    streamlit
    streamlit-extras
    ```
    Then run the installation command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    streamlit run home.py
    ```
    The application should now be open in your web browser.
